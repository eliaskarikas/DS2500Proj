# DS2500_CovidAnalysisProject
University Project for analyzing worldwide COVID-19 Policy Response. Determining most impactful policy to curb spread of COVID-19.

The COVID-19 pandemic has affected and changed all of our lives - from how we work to
how we interact with one another. With the virus constantly transforming our society,
government responses play a key role in managing the pandemic. There is still a lot of public discourse 
around different covid policies (i.e. if facial coverings or border closures are effective in controlling the 
amount of COVID-19cases). With this project, we are interested in examining the effectiveness of different
government policies in each country and how much of a key role each policy played in
preventing the spread of COVID-19.

Through data analysis, we hope to find policy effectiveness, and if certain indicators like
wealth have an effect on COVID outcome. Our research could help support general discourse surrounding the
pandemic, and potentially encourage individuals or countries to support certain policies.

Our Analysis can be found in the *FINAL* folder within this repository.
Within that folder there is a write-up indicating our understanding of policy effectiveness, 
along with analysis, visualizations, and takeaways.
Additionally, there is supporting code, in the general repository our data files and various other files can be found.
